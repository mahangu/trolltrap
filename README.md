Troll Trap is a WordPress plugin that selectively filters and modifies comments based on keywords found in them.

**NOTE: This plugin is currently in early development, and is NOT meant for use on production/live sites.**

Troll Trap's functionality is twofold:

1) Filter incoming comments based on keyword. 

The list of keywords to filter can be found under Settings > Discussion > Troll Trap. This 'Comment Graylist' functions exactly like WordPress' default Comment Blacklist, and checks the content, name, URL, email and IP address of each comment that is posted.

2) Manipulate / obfuscate the text of comments that are filtered. 

Currently, each comment can be automatically converted to piglatin, or be reversed, or disemvowled, with more filters to come. Comments that are not automatically filtered can also be manually filtered via the Comments panel.
