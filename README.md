Troll Trap is a WordPress plugin that selectively filters and modifies comments based on keywords found in them.

**NOTE: This plugin is currently in early development, and is NOT meant for use on production/live sites.**

Troll Trap's functionality is twofold:

1) Filter incoming comments based on keyword, and automatically manipulate / obfuscate them.

The list of keywords to filter can be found under Settings > Discussion > Troll Trap. This 'Comment Graylist' functions exactly like WordPress' default Comment Blacklist, and checks the content, name, URL, email and IP address of each comment that is posted.

Currently, each comment can be automatically converted to piglatin, or be reversed, or disemvowled, with more filters to come.

2) Use the same text obfuscation filters on existing comments via the Comments panel.

Basically, Troll Trap strives to create a level of comment moderation between `Approved` and `Unapproved`, allowing you to keep some comments visible on your site while still making their content inaccessible to your readers.
